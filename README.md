# ParticleGame

## Description
ParticleGame is designed to explore the physics of moving charged particles. It
features several levels of increasing difficulty with various charged and
uncharged components. The object of the game is to direct a user particle into
a goal zone and can use various level particles to help reach the goal. The level
particles will depend on the level being played, and the user will be able to
edit some (but not all) of the parameters of the level particles (such as
charge, mass, position, and velocity).

## How to Play
The goal is to guide your particle (in green) to the target zone (also in green).
Depending on the level, there might be other particles (in black) that can be
used to help you in your goal.

On the side in EDIT mode, you can see the physical starting charateristics of
the particles, with your particle always first. A movable particle can be
dragged around on the canvas while a stationary one cannot. On each level,
there may be some charateristics fields that can or cannot be edited. If the
velocity is editable, you may also drag around the red velocity vector to edit
the particle's velocity.

Once you hit GO, the simulation will start. Particles will enact electric and
magnetic forces on each other. Each particle will have several arrows from its
center that you can use to help you. The green arrows display the direction and
magnitude of electic forces, one for each electric interaction. The same
applies for the blue arrows and magnetic forces. The red arrow denotes the
direction and magitude of the particle's velocity.

You can hit EDIT at any time to retry and RESET to restart the level with its
initial configurations. Once you guide your green particle to the goal zone,
you can move on to the next level. Have fun!
