# ParticleGame

## Description
ParticleGame is designed to explore the physics of moving charged particles. It
features several levels of increasing difficulty with various charged and
uncharged components. The object of the game is to direct a user particle into
a goal zone and can use various level particles to help reach the goal. The level
particles will depend on the level being played, and the user will be able to
edit some (but not all) of the parameters of the level particles (such as
charge, mass, position, and velocity).
